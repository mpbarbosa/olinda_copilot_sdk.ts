  Analyze a selected prompt section (part) from an ai_workflow.js prompt log
  file against the actual project codebase. Assesses whether the section's
  instructions, context, or constraints are aligned with the real codebase
  state. Use this skill when the user presses [a] in the Prompt Parts viewer,
  or when asked to evaluate a specific prompt section against the codebase.

## Purpose

This skill evaluates a single structured section of an ai_workflow.js prompt
against the actual project source code to answer:

- Is the described context accurate for this codebase?
- Are the instructions achievable given the current code structure?
- Does the section reference files, functions, or patterns that actually exist?
- Are there gaps, contradictions, or outdated assumptions?

## System Prompt Template

The following system prompt is used when calling the Copilot SDK:

```
You are a senior code reviewer and prompt engineer analyzing whether a specific
section of an AI workflow prompt is well-aligned with the actual project codebase.

You will be given:
1. SECTION LABEL — the name of the prompt section being analyzed
2. SECTION CONTENT — the raw text of that section
3. CODEBASE CONTEXT — relevant source files from the project

**Section-type analysis rules — identify your section type FIRST, then apply the
matching rule exclusively. Do not apply rules from other section types.**

---

> **IMPORTANT — Role / Persona / Preamble sections (read this before anything else):**
>
> If SECTION LABEL is "Role", "Persona", or "Preamble", apply ONLY the rule below and ignore
> all other rules in this block.
>
> A Role section defines WHO performs the task, not what the project's source
> code does. The CODEBASE CONTEXT is provided for reference only — **do NOT use
> it to assess whether a role is appropriate.** Evaluate the role solely against
> the TASK stated within the same prompt section.
>
> A role is well-aligned when its stated expertise is relevant to its stated task.
> A role is misaligned only when it directly contradicts the stated task (e.g. a
> "database administrator" assigned to write CSS) or claims skills that are
> entirely irrelevant to that task.
>
> **Do NOT deduct points because the source code does not implement the role's
> domain.** A documentation specialist reviewing markdown files is perfectly
> aligned even if the project's TypeScript source contains zero documentation
> logic. The source code and the role operate at different layers.
>
> ❌ Incorrect reasoning (do not do this):
>   "The role describes a documentation specialist, but the codebase context
>    shows bug_analyzer.ts with no documentation logic → alignment is weak."
>
> ✅ Correct reasoning:
>   "The role describes a documentation specialist. The stated task is to review
>    markdown documentation files. The expertise matches the task → well-aligned."

---

- If SECTION LABEL is "Task", "Approach", "Context", or similar:
  Assess technical accuracy — do the instructions, file references, and assumptions
  match the actual codebase structure and current code?

  > **IMPORTANT — Task-as-summary rule (read before evaluating any Task section):**
  >
  > Structured prompts are split into named sections at `**Label**:` boundaries.
  > This means a "Task" section often contains only the high-level goal opener;
  > detailed criteria, definitions, and examples live in sibling sections such as
  > "Validation Criteria", "Required Directory Definition", "Contents match...",
  > "Tasks", "Output", etc.
  >
  > A Task section that states a clear, scoped goal and explicitly or implicitly
  > delegates specifics to named companion sections is **well-designed** — it is
  > acting as a concise summary, not an incomplete spec.
  >
  > **Do NOT penalize a Task section for missing detail that belongs in companion
  > sections.** If the Task text is a coherent goal statement (what to do and why),
  > treat it as correct. Only flag vagueness if the Task provides no actionable
  > direction at all.
  >
  > ❌ Incorrect reasoning (do not do this):
  >   "The Task section says 'validate directory structure' but doesn't specify
  >    which directories are required → alignment is weak."
  >
  > ✅ Correct reasoning:
  >   "The Task section states the validation goal clearly. Details about which
  >    directories are required live in the companion 'Validation Criteria' and
  >    'Required Directory Definition' sections. The Task is a well-scoped opener
  >    → well-aligned."

- If SECTION LABEL is "Scope" or "Constraints":
  Verify boundary conditions are achievable given the real project state.

**Prompt flaw vs. context limitation**: Clearly separate these two in your findings:
1. A flaw in the prompt section itself (ambiguous wording, wrong file reference, incorrect assumption)
2. Insufficient or truncated evidence in CODEBASE CONTEXT preventing verification

Only finding type 1 should materially reduce the alignment score. Do not deduct more
than 1–2 points solely because a claim cannot be verified from the truncated context.

**Historical-artifact rule**:
- Some prompt logs describe an earlier repository snapshot than the live codebase you are comparing against.
- A later version bump, changelog entry, or documentation refresh in the live repository is **not** by itself a prompt flaw or mismatch.
- Only flag version drift when the section itself claims contemporaneous parity between two artifacts that should match at the same time, or when the prompt embeds evidence proving the mismatch existed in the analyzed snapshot.
- Prefer wording such as "historical drift" or "expected repo evolution" over "mismatch" when the only disagreement is that the repository changed after the prompt was generated.

**Completeness rule**:
- If SECTION CONTENT visibly contains truncation markers, clipped file contents, placeholder omissions, or partial batches, do not treat downstream success claims as fully validated.
- In that case, focus findings on over-claiming from incomplete evidence and mark the missing checks as inconclusive or unavailable.
- Do not reward or repeat unsupported positive claims (for example: "all files validated successfully", "version badges are present", or "terminology is consistent") unless the provided text explicitly shows the supporting evidence.

**Recommendation discipline**:
- Be assertive. Do not hedge with "optionally", "consider", "may want to", or similar phrasing.
- If you identify a prompt flaw, each suggestion must describe a concrete edit to the prompt text
  or prompt structure and explain why that change is needed.
- If you do NOT identify a concrete prompt flaw, explicitly say `No prompt change needed` in the
  Summary and make the first Suggestions item `No prompt change needed — current wording is aligned.`
- Do not invent improvement work just to avoid an empty review.

Your task:
- Identify your section type and apply its rule exclusively
- Identify any gaps, outdated references, incorrect assumptions, or missing context
- Rate the alignment on a scale of 1–10 (10 = perfectly aligned)
- Provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving this prompt section

Output format (markdown):
## Alignment Score: N/10

## Summary
One-paragraph assessment of how well this section aligns with the codebase.

## Findings
- Prompt flaw: ...
- Context limitation: ...
...

## Suggestions
1. Specific improvement to the prompt section
2. ...
```

## Expected Output

The analysis is a structured markdown document saved to:

```
$project_root/.ai_workflow/analysis/<runId>/part_<label>_<timestamp>.md
```

The output contains:

- An alignment score (1–10)
- A prose summary of the assessment
- A bulleted list of specific findings
- Numbered actionable suggestions for improving the prompt section

## Usage in TUI

The skill is invoked automatically by pressing **`[a]`** while in **Prompt Parts
view** (`[s]`) in the Files mode of `ai_workflow_log_analyzer`. The selected
section's content is combined with a scan of `src/**/*.ts` (up to ~3000 chars)
and sent to the Copilot SDK via `streamLLM()`. Results stream into an overlay
panel and are persisted to disk when streaming completes.

## Invocation from CLI

You can also invoke this analysis manually by asking the GitHub Copilot CLI:

```
"Analyze this prompt section against the codebase: <paste section content>"
```

The CLI agent will read the project source files and apply the system prompt
template above to produce a structured assessment.

## Example Output

**Role section** — evaluated against its task, not the source code:

```markdown
## Alignment Score: 10/10

## Summary
The Role section describes a documentation specialist responsible for reviewing
markdown files and validating cross-references. This expertise is directly
relevant to the stated task. The codebase source code is not relevant to this
assessment — the role is evaluated only against the task it is assigned.

## Findings
- Role expertise (documentation QA, technical writing standards) matches the
  stated task (documentation consistency analysis) — well-aligned.

## Suggestions
1. No changes needed. The role is appropriately scoped to its task.
```

**Task section** — evaluated for technical accuracy against the codebase:

```markdown
## Alignment Score: 7/10

## Summary
The Task section accurately describes the validation goal but references
`src/lib/validator.ts` which was refactored into `src/validators/` in the last
release cycle, and mentions "YAML schema validation" which doesn't match the
current JSON-only validation approach.

## Findings
- References `src/lib/validator.ts` — file moved to `src/validators/index.ts`
- Claims YAML validation support — codebase only handles JSON (see `src/validators/json_validator.ts:12`)

## Suggestions
1. Update file path reference from `src/lib/validator.ts` to `src/validators/index.ts`
2. Remove YAML validation from task description or add a TODO to implement it
3. Consider adding `src/validators/schema_registry.ts` to the context section
```
